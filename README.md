# Server-side Calculator


## Description

In this project, we were tasked with goal of creating a simple calculator. The challenge with this was that all data and calculations had to processed on a server. This required me to have to make axios GET and POST requests on the client side, which is something that we are just learning how to do. 

[Here](./TODO.md) is the plan and structure that I came up with for this project. 

I was able to achieve all of the stretch goals except to change the tests so that the calculator that had the buttons would pass as well. 

Some challenges that I ran into were that the client-side tests didn't pass with the first method I tried of appending the calculator result and history to the DOM. I had to hard-code the HTML to get it to work.
